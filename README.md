# Export Optimizer

Enable **Export Optimizer** in Project Settings → Plugins. In Project → Export,
enable **Optimization → Structs** for each preset that should optimize tagged data
classes. The option defaults off and applies to both debug and release exports.
Godot stores it in `export_presets.cfg`.

The plugin uses `addons/addon_lib/gdscript_optimizer`; release packaging vendors the
shared dependencies through PluginExporter. It requires Godot 4.6 or newer.

Project scripts are analyzed together before any replacements are emitted. Only
files selected by Godot's export are replaced. Globals and resource paths survive,
and project source files are never edited. Analysis includes indexed scripts even
when the preset excludes them, so invalid tagged test code can disable optimization.

If preflight fails, the export log reports errors and **all original code** is
exported. Godot may still return a successful command-line exit code; this is not
a strict CI validation gate. Existing struct warnings remain warnings.

Changed scripts are stored as `.gd` source in the package. Unchanged scripts follow
the preset's format. Binary-token output for changed scripts is deferred; the source
transform is independent of encoding. PCK encryption still applies when its filters
match the replacement `.gd` paths. A filter limited to `*.gdc` will miss those files.

The file hook is named `ExportOptimizer` to precede Godot's `GDScript` exporter. Other
plugins that replace these same files must not intercept them first.

Validation:

```sh
godot --headless --path . --script res://tests/export_optimizer/run_headless.gd
python3 tests/export_optimizer/export_smoke.py --godot /path/to/godot
```
